# Estimation of the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections 

Supporting materials for Nishiura et al "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections" Submitted 2020

Our notebooks repository can be divided on two groups:

**1. Inference of the serial interval using only infector-infectee pairs identified from the literature with high certainty**
* [A1. Stan simulations.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/A1.%20Stan%20simulations.ipynb) Code to run MCMC simulations in cmdStan
* [A2. Processing the traces.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/A2.%20Processing%20the%20traces.ipynb) Python script to analyse posterior distirubions generated by Stan

**2. Inference of the serial interval using only infector-infectee pairs identified as certain or probable**
* [B1. Stan simulations including probable cases.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/B1.%20Stan%20simulations%20including%20probable%20cases.ipynb) Code to run MCMC simulations in cmdStan
* [B2. Processing the traces for certain and probable cases.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/B2.%20Processing%20the%20traces%20for%20certain%20and%20probable%20cases.ipynb) Python script to analyse posterior distirubions generated by Stan

[**NB**] Words of caution: Thank you for your interest to our work. We would like to note that our code is not supposed to work out of box, because the links used in the notebooks were user-specific, and our main intent was to show the relevance of the methods used in our paper.
