# Estimation of the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections 

Supporting materials for Nishiura et al "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections" Submitted 2020

Our notebooks repository can be divided on two groups:

**1. Inference of the serial interval using only infector-infectee pairs identified from the literature with high certainty**
* [A1. Stan simulations.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/A1.%20Stan%20simulations.ipynb) Code to run MCMC simulations in cmdStan
* [A2. Processing the traces.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/A2.%20Processing%20the%20traces.ipynb) Python script to analyse posterior distirubions generated by Stan

**2. Inference of the serial interval using only infector-infectee pairs identified as certain or probable**
* [B1. Stan simulations including probable cases.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/B1.%20Stan%20simulations%20including%20probable%20cases.ipynb) Code to run MCMC simulations in cmdStan
* [B2. Processing the traces for certain and probable cases.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/B2.%20Processing%20the%20traces%20for%20certain%20and%20probable%20cases.ipynb) Python script to analyse posterior distirubions generated by Stan

**3. Generating Figure 1**
* [C. Generating the figure.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInterval2020/blob/master/scripts/C.%20Generating%20the%20figure.ipynb)

**4. Additional details**
* The folder **results** contains all constructed traceplots, as well as individual traces for the parameters of the distributions. As such, param1 & param2 in csv or pickle files are respectively the meanlog and sdlog for the lognormal distribution, the shape and inverse scale for the gamma distribution, and the shape and scale for the Weibull distribution. We followed the notation according to Stan manual (see the pages on [lognormal](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_22/functions-reference/lognormal.html), [gamma](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_22/functions-reference/gamma-distribution.html), and [Weibull](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_22/functions-reference/weibull-distribution.html) distributions). The ```scipy.stats``` notation for each distribution follows the code: ```ss.lognorm(param2,scale=np.exp(param1))```, ```ss.gamma(param1,scale=1/param2)```, and ```ss.weibull_min(param1,scale=param2)```, respectively. Here ```ss``` and ```np``` are shortcuts for ```scipy.stats``` and ```numpy``` libraries in Python.

**Thank you for your interest to our work!** 

Few words of caution: We would like to note that our code is not supposed to work out of box, because the links used in the notebooks were user-specific, and our main intent was to show the relevance of the methods used in our paper.
